Paragraph tag "My name is <b> Matthew Stahulak </b> and I am a fifth-year student from Naperville, Illinois. I am majoring in Business Management and also looking to receive certificates in Supply Chain Management and Information Systems and Technology. I grew up interested in computers and have always been incredibly tech-savvy. My interests include traveling, EDM music, music festivals/concerts, and spending quality time with my friends and family. <br> <br> I currently work for a supply chain and logistics company called RIM Logistics as a <em> Technology Support Specialist.</em> I started with this company as an intern 2 summers ago and hope to move up the ranks within their IT department. In my job, I manage a help desk and receive requests from employees around the company and troubleshoot their issues/concerns within the Logistics software we use, <em> CargoWise </em>. I recently achieved the highest level of certification within CargoWise's certification program and hope to expand and apply my knowledge in the years to come. "
