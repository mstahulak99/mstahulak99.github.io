<h1 class = test>Welcome to my webpage! The objective of this web page is to provide basic knowledge of the Supply Chain and Logistics industry and entail what day-to-day work looks like for new interns. 
</h1>
<h2> I think the term “Supply Chain” is incredibly vague and this website will be able to bridge that gap to entail what daily work looks like and how the company functions.</h2>
<p>This will not only expand my knowledge of the industry I currently work for, but also I am hoping to use this website to show new hires and interns to help them learn as well. I am choosing to create an educational website because the intern orientation process of the current company I work for could definitely use some help, and no better opportunity to help out with that than this class and website. To have a website interns can always reference if they run into trouble is very valuable to have in the company</p>
