My name is Matthew Stahulak and I am a fifth-year student from Naperville, Illinois. I am majoring in Business Management and looking to receive certificates in Supply Chain Management and Information Systems and Technology. I grew up interested in computers and have always been incredibly tech-savvy. I currently work for a supply chain and logistics company called RIM Logistics as a Technology Support Specialist. I have a bit of experience in HTML and CSS as I began to self-teach myself a couple of years ago but never followed through with it. I figured that taking a class through university would make me much more motivated to learn it. My expectations for this class are to hopefully grasp the concepts and context of HTML and CSS and build a fully functional website. I hope to apply the skills learned in this class to my current job and start building websites for them. My interests include traveling, EDM music, music festivals/concerts, and spending quality time with my friends and family.
